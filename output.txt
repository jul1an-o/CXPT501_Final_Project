Test #1: Paired T Test for Baseline vs. Week 4 NT-proBNP
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0

Test #2: Paired T Test for Baseline vs. Week 8 NT-proBNP
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0
