Test #1
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0

Test #2
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0

We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Test #5
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use an Independent T-Test because the observations being compared come from different groups; first we must assess the variance

The Levene test has a p-value of:  1.054209343166279e-10  and is singificant, therefore we assume the data does not have equal variance and proceed with the Welch Independent T-Test

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  7.654682030736967e-226 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Test #6
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use an Independent T-Test because the observations being compared come from different groups; first we must assess the variance

The Levene test has a p-value of:  5.636619855764233e-32  and is singificant, therefore we assume the data does not have equal variance and proceed with the Welch Independent T-Test

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Test #7
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use an Independent T-Test because the observations being compared come from different groups; first we must assess the variance

The Levene test has a p-value of:  0.0002981293092348587  and is singificant, therefore we assume the data does not have equal variance and proceed with the Welch Independent T-Test

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  7.052467560068001e-83

Test #8
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use an Independent T-Test because the observations being compared come from different groups; first we must assess the variance

The Levene test has a p-value of:  8.549181811930662e-11  and is singificant, therefore we assume the data does not have equal variance and proceed with the Welch Independent T-Test

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  1.2801452852353718e-137
