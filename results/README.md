For the enalapril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 4 NT-proBNP levels?
For the enalapril group, is there a significant difference between pre-treatment and Week 8 NT-proBNP levels?
Is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 4 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)?
Is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 8 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)?
Among participants aged 60 or older, is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 4 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)?
Among participants aged 60 or older, is there a significant difference in NT-proBNP levels at Week 8 between the two groups (sacubitril and enalapril)?
The hypothesis_test_2.txt contains results for the following tests:
