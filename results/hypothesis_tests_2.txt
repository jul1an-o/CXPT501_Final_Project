Test #1: Paired T Test for Baseline vs. Week 4 NT-proBNP
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 4 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0

Test #2: Paired T Test for Baseline vs. Week 8 NT-proBNP
We are interested in comparing these two groups: Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL) and Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL)


We will use a Paired T-Test because the observations being compared come from the same sample

There is a significant difference between Group 1:  Week 8 NT-proBNP (pg/mL)  and Group 2:  Pre-treatment NT-proBNP (pg/mL) with a p-value of:  0.0

For the Paired T-Test between the Baseline vs. Week 4 NT-proBNP, our hypotheses are as follows:
H0: The mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 4 
H1: The mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is not equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 4 
Since the p-value is < .05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 4.

For the Paired T-Test between the Baseline vs. Week 8 NT-proBNP, our hypotheses are as follows:
H0: The mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 8
H1: The mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is not equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 8
Since the p-value is < .05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean NT-proBNP at Baseline is equal to the mean NT-proBNP at Week 8.
